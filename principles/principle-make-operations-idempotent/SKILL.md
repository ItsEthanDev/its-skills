# Make Operations Idempotent

Design operations so they converge to the correct state regardless of how many times they run or where they start from. Every state-mutating operation should answer: "What happens if this runs twice? What happens if the previous run crashed halfway?"

**Why:** Commands, lifecycle operations, and processing loops run where crashes, restarts, and retries are normal. If partial state changes the next run's outcome, every restart becomes a debugging session.

**The pattern:**
- Convergent startup: scan for existing state, clean stale artifacts, adopt live sessions
- Content-based cleanup: compare by content equivalence, not creation order
- Self-healing locks: follow explicit direction or an intentional project lock-ownership and recovery convention. For local process-owned locks, default to PID-based stale detection when the owning process's identity and liveness can be checked reliably, accounting for PID reuse and namespaces. Use environment-appropriate ownership and recovery checks for other lock models.
- Idempotent scheduling: failed work respawns cleanly, fresh input regenerated after each cycle

**The test:**
1. What happens if this runs twice in a row?
2. What happens if the previous run crashed at every possible point?
3. Does re-execution converge to the same end state?

If any answer is "it depends on what state was left behind," the operation needs a reconciliation step.
